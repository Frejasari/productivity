# Productivity | Fullstack Application

[Link to the project](http://productivity-2.herokuapp.com/ "Login Page")

Productivity is a fullstack application which I created with my friend [Steffi](https://github.com/steffriedrichs) as our 2nd project in the Ironhack Bootcamp. It is an easy-to-use application to plan small projects and keep track of all the stuff you need to do and see what you already achieved.

Technologies we used:

- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB, mongoose
- JS, jQuery
- Bootstrap, Handlebars

## Why another planning tool?

When it comes to productivity tools we think the most important thing is, that they are easy and intuitive to use. We don't want to spend our time on figuring out how the tool works and neither do we want to plan everything in excruciating detail but we want just the right amount of structure to get things done.
That's why we created this application.

### Profile Page

A project consists of certain subtask-packages which are divided into to-dos.
