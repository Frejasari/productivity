# how to add / edit a package? 
    - save button?
    - save on focus change?
    - save every X seconds? ---> Then check for changes, and only save if there are changes (how?)

# change the order of the taskPackages and store that in the Database?

# Name ?
- the git project is called "productivity" - I'd assume that's the name

# Different landing page if you are logged in 
  - maybe with a button to create a new project

# If you are logged out: Example Project, to see how it looks?

# Calendar / Timeline / Due Dates?
- I would add a deadline or planned finish date to the individual packages / the project
